/**
 * An aggregate function is a specific type of group 
 * function that takes all records in a group, and 
 * outputs only one row.  The output columns of an 
 * aggregate function can still be one to many columns.
 * <p>
 * 
 * To implement an aggregate function, override the methods 
 * {@link #consume(Tuple)} and {@link #getComputedResult()} 
 * as well as implement the logic in these two methods.  The 
 * consume method is called by Mobius each time there 
 * is a new  record in a group.  Users can store some partially 
 * computed results during this stage.  The {@link #getComputedResult()} 
 * method returns one tuple; users should implement the logic of 
 * basing the final result on the partial results here.  
 * <p>
 * 
 * Note that, the schema of the returned tuple is the 
 * same as the schema Mobius retrieved from {@link #getOutputSchema()}.
